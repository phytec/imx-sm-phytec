@defgroup BRD_SM BOARD: SM Board Interface

@brief Module for the board interface for the SM.

Board Module
============

This module abstracts the board. It contains a common API and implementations for each
supported board.

 * @defgroup BRD_SM_API SM Board API
 * @brief Module for the board interface API.
 *
 * This module provides a common API for the SM board layer. It contains most functions
 * and types to call the SM board layer of code. The brd_sm.h file also allows defines
 * to redirect calls from the SM device API that go to device functions to instead
 * go to board functions. Those functions then usually add resources or functionality
 * but still call the device function for device resources. See the
 * [device API](@ref DEV_SM_API) for a list of these redirection defines.
 *
 * For example, in brd_sm.h:
 *
 *     #define SM_SENSORNAMEGET       BRD_SM_SensorNameGet
 *
 * Would redirct calls for device sensors names made via ::SM_SENSORNAMEGET to
 * BRD_SM_SensorNameGet() instead of DEV_SM_SensorNameGet().
