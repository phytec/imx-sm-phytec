@defgroup DEV_SM DEVICE: SM Device Interface

@brief Module for the device interface for the SM.

Device Module {#DEV_SM_DETAIL}
=============

This module abstracts the SoC device. It contains a common API and
implementations for each supported SoC.

 * @brief Module for the device interface API.
 *
 * This module provides a common API for the SM device layer. It contains most functions
 * and  types to call the SM device layer of code. It also contain redirection macros
 * for most of those functions. This allows brd_sm.h defines to redirect calls
 * from the SM that go to device functions to instead go to board functions. Those
 * functions then usually add resources or functionality but still call the device
 * function for device resources.
 *
 * For example, in brd_sm.h:
 * 
 *     #define SM_SENSORNAMEGET       BRD_SM_SensorNameGet
 * 
 * Would redirct calls for device sensors names made via ::SM_SENSORNAMEGET to
 * BRD_SM_SensorNameGet() instead of DEV_SM_SensorNameGet().
