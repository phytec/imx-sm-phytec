Additional Notes {#RN_ADD}
================

This section details any additional notes about the original release. These do not cover
changes in patch releases.

General {#RN_ADD_GEN}
=======

When the SM is compiled for release into production devices, it is **critical** that this
is done without the debug monitor (M=0). The default is monitor enabled (M=1). For example:

	make config=mx95evk M=0

Turning off the debug monitor will eliminate the linking of the standard C library.

The tool chain used with this SM is Arm GNU Toolchain Version **12.3.Rel1** obtained from 
[Arm GNU Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/GNU%20Toolchain).
Use the x86_64 Linux hosted AArch32 bare-metal target (arm-none-eabi) toolchain.

Supported development environments include Ubuntu 2020.04, 2022.04, and 2024.04. Supported
versions of doxygen include 1.8.17, 1.9.1, and 1.9.8.
