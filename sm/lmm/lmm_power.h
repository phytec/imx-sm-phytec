 *
 * This function requests the power state for a power domain be set for
 * a specific LM. The requested \a powerState is saved for the power domain
 * \a domainID for the LM indicated by \a lmId. The aggregation policy is to
 * set the underlying state of that power domain to the maximum power state
 * requested by any LM for that domain. This is done by looping through all
 * of the saved states to find the max and then passing that on to the device
 * or board. Note the power domains and power states are device/board specific
 * and this function doesn't interpret them other than to assume a higher
 * numbered power state satisfies the power needs of a lower numbered state.
 *
 * @return Returns the status (::SM_ERR_SUCCESS = success).
 *
 * Return errors (see @ref STATUS "SM error codes"):
 * - ::SM_ERR_SUCCESS: if the power state is set.
 * - ::SM_ERR_INVALID_PARAMETERS if \a lmId out of range
